## 🌟 Core Content  

### I. Theoretical Foundations  
1. **General Systems Theory (GST)**  
   - Meta-systems & subsystems  
   - Key properties (entropy, homeostasis, synergy)  
   - Classification: open/closed, deterministic/stochastic  
2. **System Semantics**  
   - Conceptual modeling  
   - Common issues: coupling, redundancy  

### II. Strategic Systems  
3. **Organizational Management**  
   - Value chain (Porter's model)  
   - Market segmentation  
4. **Information Systems**  
   - Supply Chain Management (SCM)  
   - Customer Relationship Management (CRM)  
   - Business Intelligence (BI)  

### III. Technical Components  
5. **Intelligent Systems**  
   - Expert systems  
   - Case-based reasoning  
   - AI-driven management  
6. **Support Systems**  
   - Data/model-driven DSS  
   - Hybrid systems

## 🔑 Key Resources
### Models & Diagrams
  - Flowchart Templates: 1. Purchase process → 2. Segmentation → 3. CRM analysis
#### System Classification Matrix:
| Criterion | Example |  
|---------------------|---------------------|  
| - Complexity<br>- Purpose<br>| Expert system vs DSS<br> Strategic vs Tactical<br>| 

  - Hybrid DSS Workflow: Data → Predictive model → User interface → Decision
  - Organizational AI Cycle: Data → Learning → Inference → Action → Feedback
